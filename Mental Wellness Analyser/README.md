# Mental-Wellness-Analyzer

This project leverages **Machine Learning** and **Data Science** to analyze behavioral and psychological patterns in order to predict potential **mental health conditions** such as **Anxiety, Depression, Stress, and Loneliness**. The model empowers early detection and awareness, which is crucial for mental well-being.

# Key Highlights - **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering** on **40,960 behavioral records** to enhance model reliability. - **Logistic Regression ML Model** trained with **good Accuracy** in classifying multiple mental health disorders. - **End-to-End Deployment** using Python, Scikit-Learn, and an interactive web interface for real-world usability.
